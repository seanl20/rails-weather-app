### Setup

You'll first need to install Ruby 3.3.4. We recommend doing so using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

once you have ruby, use `bin/setup` to start installing the app. You might encounter some errors.
If so, don't worry. Just try to resolve them, then run `bin/setup` again.
Keep going until the script runs successfully.

If you are using windows like me it would be better for you to follow step 1-3 of this guide that I found on [Reddit](https://pagertree.com/blog/getting-started-with-ruby-on-rails-in-2024-the-complete-development-environment-guide): https://pagertree.com/blog/getting-started-with-ruby-on-rails-in-2024-the-complete-development-environment-guide
It is possible for you to follow the rest of the steps but I only did the first 3 steps before using rbenv.

### Running
To run the app, use `bin/dev` as this project uses tailwindcss for the styling.

### Application
This project is base of the youtube videos from Typefast where he guides people through how to create a weather app.
